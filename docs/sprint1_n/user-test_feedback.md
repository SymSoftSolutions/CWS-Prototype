#User Test Feedback
We performed in-person user testing with Ruchi. She had no previous knowledge of the project, and tested the three main tasks with specific user-roles in mind:
- [Test 1 – Creating a new account (Desktop)] (#test-1)
- [Test 2 – Log in as a Case Worker (Desktop)] (#test-2)
- [Test 3 – Login as Foster Parent (Mobile)] (#test-3)

##Test 1 – Creating a new account (Desktop)<a id="test-1"></a>
- Device: Macintosh Desktop
- Operating System: Mac OS X
- Browser: Chrome

###1. Create a profile and set preferences 
#### Creating a new user account
- I go to the website, enter information, and sign up as a new user.
- I receive an error message, and am confused (it says this user already exists).
- After I enter in the text, I go to the login scren.
- **"What is the username?" I feel confused, because when I signed up on the website, I don't recall adding a username, just my email.**
- After I register, I go to the login page. Should I go somewhere else? 

###2. Find a residential facility nearby
####Titles at top of the page
- **"What is 'something'?" This placeholder text doesn't mean anything to me.**
- I click on "read more" and nothing happens. If this link doesn't do anything, it should be removed.

####Foster parent locations
- What's the order of the list? Is it alphabetical? Right now it seems all random.
- It seems that the order should be based on zip code, but I don't remember giving my location...
- I click up at the links at the top menu, clicked on "Home" from the browser menu.
- I click on "Foster Agency" at the top. I got confused and clicked back at th main menu.
- I go back down to the map, and find a foster agency, I see the phone number and web address to contact them from the map.

####Profile icon
- I click on my name at the top menu, and go to my profile page.
- It seems that I should have gone to this page after registering for the first time.
- I click through all of the profile preferences, and they seem to be working just fine. The questions make sense.
- I see the Case Worker assigned to me at the top of the page. **The text here is too small, and I'm afraid it will get lost.** I want to click on this to get more information about the Case Worker.
- I click on the profile icon, and drag an image from my desktop to the profile icon. It doesn't update. The developer tells me he's still working on that part :)
- **There should be some meaningful information when I click the 'info' icon.** As a user, it should specifically talk about what we're doing here.

####Inbox
- **How do I send an email? I'm confused.**
- I see the "New Message" button and write out a sample email, I check the "Sent" folder and see that it went through. **The time is not right in the email.**
- I try to send another email, and see that it did not got through. I refresh the page. **I'm not sure how to get back to the inbox after sending, and it seems slow loading...**

####Find a phone number for a case worker
- How do I know to contact a case worker?
- **I want to be able to click the case worker from my profile to get contact information for them.**

##Test 2 – Log in as a Case Worker (Desktop) <a id="test-2"></a>
- Device: ThinkPad laptop
- Operating System: Windows
- Browser: Internet Explorer

####Inbox
- I go to the inbox, view the "Sent" folder, and look through the messages. Looks to be the same functionality as before, working fine.
- **Why is the inbox showing 'No data available?'** This is confusing.
- **The Logout button (in the main menu) is getting cutoff on the right hand side.**

##Test 3 – Login as Foster Parent (Mobile) <a id="test-3"></a>
- Device: iPhone
- Operating System: iOS
- Browser: Safari

####General comments for mobile
- **For a website like this, I'd prefer an app.** I typed in the URL to the browser, and received an error. There was a misspelling.
- So far everything seems to be working well on the phone.
- I'd prefer to use this site on my phone, but I think the expereicne would be better on desktop.

####Map
- I'm not able to find the list of agencies, the list isn't showing up right away. The list eventually loads. **On the desktop view, maybe make the list a bit smaller, I'd like to see more of the map on the desktop.**

####User Profile
- On the profile, **the image is overlapping with the text.**

####Main menu
- The "logout" button is really close to the email button. **It's a small thing, but people with big fingers may accidentally press the "Logout" instead of "email" because they're so close together.**
- **Is there supposed to be a logo on mobile?**
