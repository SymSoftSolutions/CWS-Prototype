Each owner was responsible for getting that User Story/task completed according to the definition of done in close collaboration with the rest of the team.

During our daily scrums, we reviewed our tasks for the day, made sure that each team member understood their role and communicate any possible impediments to the ScrumMaster. To prioritize and estimate tasks, we  used the [planning poker technique] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker).

##Mobile Testing
We executed manual mobile testing across multiple mobile operative systems and devices including Android, iOS and Windows Phone
