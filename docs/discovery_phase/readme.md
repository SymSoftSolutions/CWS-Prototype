**Discovery Phase**
-------------------
We started the project by reviewing the RFI in detail and understanding the State goals during this effort. We also identified how SymSoft Solutions Agile expertise and User Centered Design processes matches the State requirements. 

After the initial analysis and In order to create an initial backlog for the project, we focused our efforts on identifying resources to help us to understand more about:

1. How Foster care works
2. How the information from CHHS Open Data is being used
3. The roles of Foster parents, case workers and interactions between them

We achieved this, by doing research on different information sources.

Websites Research
-----------------
![Websites Research](/docs/discovery_phase/images/websites.png)

We did a research on relevant websites, some of the most relevant we look into are listed below:

[California Department of Social Services – Foster Parent Program](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/PG123.htm)

This helped us to understand foster care program and the actors involved during the process of becoming a foster parent.

[Foster Family Home Application](http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/English/LIC283.pdf)

By looking into this application we identified the data fields captured during the actual application to get a foster family license. We used this to define the information to be part the Parent profile for the prototype development.

[The CDSS Care Facility Search web page](https://secure.dss.ca.gov/CareFacilitySearch/home/index) 

We identified how the CHHS Open data is being used for an existing application. We also identified some additional useful information being used which was not part of this project data set but that effort resulted in a better understanding of the user interaction with this data.

[TIES for family’s website](http://www.tiesforadoption.ucla.edu/)

The foster parent we interviewed during the discovery phase mentioned this as the resource he used when he started the process of becoming a Foster Parent. After looking into the parent resources section for adoption and foster care, we managed to look into multiple agencies websites to learn more about the resources available for parents to understand Foster Care and the process. 

[Foster Parent FAQs](http://www.childsworld.ca.gov/PG1347.htm)

We were able to identify some of the most basic questions potential Foster Parents have, then we asked the foster parent we intereviewed about some of these to findout if that information was enough during the real process. This exercise was helpful during the definition of User Personas.

[California Foster Families Case Worker Job Description](http://www.cafosterfamilies.com/employment.htm)

It helped us to understand the responsibilities and duties of a case worker and interactions with foster parents

[Study.com: Job Description for a Foster Parent Case Worker](http://study.com/articles/Job_Description_of_a_Foster_Care_Caseworker.html) 

We learnt more about case workers interactions with foster parents and in which part of the process of getting a foster care license case workers are involved. 

[The Guardian: A year in the life of a foster parent](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/27/diary-of-a-foster-parent)

This was really useful for understanding Foster Parents challenges and experiences. it helped a lot for preparing the interview questions we asked during the interview to a foster parent.
