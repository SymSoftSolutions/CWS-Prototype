#Future requests for prototype
During our foster parent interview, Chris suggested several features to support foster parents and social workers, including:

##Calendar Feature
Be able to have a calendar feature to set and schedule appointments
(good for both case worker & foster parent) – both are juggling multiple schedules

##Repository for Medical Documents
Place to store and keep track of all medical documents 
(they are required to save all medical documents, and this would be good to have too in case kids get transferred)

##Support services
Help new foster parents be more aware of the support services available (more support services available to domestic adoptions than international)

##Case Worker profiles
Be able to find out what the workload is for your social worker (are they managing 40 kids or 180?)
This may be indicative of the kind of service and communications you may have with them

Based on Chris’s feedback, these additional features can be implemented in the next phase of this prototype to ease the challenges of both foster parents and case workers.
