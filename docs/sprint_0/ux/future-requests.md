#Future requests for prototype

Be able to have a calendar feature to set and schedule appointments
(good for both case worker & foster parent) – both are juggling multiple schedules

Place to store and keep track of all medical documents 
(they are required to save all medical documents, and this would be good to have too in case kids get transferred)

Help new foster parents be more aware of the support services available (more support services available to domestic adoptions than international)

Be able to find out what the workload is for your social worker (are they managing 40 kids or 180?)
This may be indicative of the kind of service and communications you may have with them
