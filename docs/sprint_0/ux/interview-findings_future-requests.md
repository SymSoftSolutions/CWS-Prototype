#Future requests for prototype
During our foster parent interview, Chris suggested several features to support foster parents and social workers. For the next phase of this project, we suggest the following based on Chris' feedback:

##Calendar 
Scheduling required home visits and other appointments is an essential to both foster parents and social workers. A calendar feature can help social workers stay organized, and remind foster parents of their next meeting. 

##Repository for Medical Documents
Because foster parents are required to report all media visits for their foster child, keeping track of all of those documents can be overwhelming. Chris suggested a single place to store and share those documents. This can be especially helpful if a child is transferred to a new home, and to help ease administrative burdens of being a foster parent.

##Support services
Chris stated that he was very fortunate to find support services (through [Ties for Adoption] (http://www.tiesforadoption.ucla.edu/)) to help him as a new foster parent. He stated that he was able to find these services through his network of colleagues, and did not think that most new foster parents were aware of these services. To really help new foster parents, they should be able to connect to organizations like Ties for Adoption, and to know that they are not alone in their experience of being a new foster parent.

##Case Worker profiles
We learned from Chris that the workload of case workers (social workers) varies from agency to agency. One case worker may be managing 40 kids, while another may be managing 180 kids. More transparency about the workload of the case workers may give insight into the type of service and communications that the foster parent receives from the case worker.
