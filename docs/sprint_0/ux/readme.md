After our interview with Chris, we created User Personas. These personas map out the pain points, motivations, needs, and challenges for Foster Parents and Social Workers. Based on Chris's feedback, we imagined the motivations for a foster parent using the web application and what functionalities might be helpful for them. Given the overwhelming workload of the Social Workers, we realized that keeping communications organized and being able to easily find and contact Foster Parents was a must-have from the point of view of a Foster Parent.
