#Notes from our interview with Chris, a foster parent

##Terminology
- **DCFS**: Department of Children and Family Services
- **FFA**: Foster Family Agency
- **Case Worker / Social Worker**: Someone who is assigned to a child and foster family. They match foster families with foster children.  This is the main person that the foster family will contact and report to.

##About Chris’ experience becoming a foster parent
- They became foster parents in 1994
- Went to intro meeting
- Found a foster family agency (FFA) – individual, private organization (funded by DCFS)
- Sign up for family training
- Get certified
- Get assigned a social worker (case worker)
- Want to know which kids are available, and what are the requirements (from the foster parents)
- Allow social workers to have more info about the foster parents

After 2 years, their social worker called and said they are so happy to have educated parents.
Most foster families are not that different from the target population (become foster parents for the $600 per month)

###Foster parents face a lot of regulations such as:

- Have to document all medical visits for their foster child
- Have a meeting with case worker (FFA) once per week
- Have a meeting with county once per month

###Communication with case workers and Documentation
They usually set up appointments by phone, but email or messaging could make the process less cumbersome.

A feature that could also really be helpful, is to provide a repository for medical documents. Sometimes kids move to different homes, and their medical records may be lost. Again, foster parents are also required to document all medical visits, so having a place to keep those (and for the case worker to refer) would be helpful

###Support services
- There are a lot of support services available to foster parents, which most foster parents may not be aware of.
- Chris received support from Ties for Adoption (affiliated with UCLA)
- These kinds of services may not be available to people who adopt internationally

###Background info on foster agencies
- DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) is at the county level
- DCFS contracts with family service agencies (known as Family Foster Agencies (FFA))
- Social workers at the county level are often responsible for up to 180 kids
- Social workers at private organization (FFA) may be responsible for about 40 kids

As a new foster parent, it’s good to know what the workload is of the social workers, knowing what level of resources are available

Once the FFA has placed a child with the foster family, the foster family is typically tied to that particular FFA. If the foster family does not like the services of the FFA, then they may switch to another agency.

###What would be useful for a digital profile (for foster parents)?
- What types of kids do they want to foster? (siblings, etc.)
- How many kids
- Age of kids
- Looking to adopt or just foster (short term vs. long term)
- Do they have any experience fostering
- Have they completed necessary training & home visits?

** Profile information is likely to change. For instance, a parent could start out just fostering, then change their mind and decide that they want to adopt the child.

Case workers (Social workers) will use the profiles to help place foster children with the right families.
Profiles may also be good for county or FFAs.

###How important is location?
Zip codes can be helpful early on in the process (of becoming a foster parent). There are required classes that foster parents need to take, and they don’t have to drive far for those classes.
