##Introductions
Hi and thanks for coming in!

###About the project
We’ll tell you a little bit about this project, and what it’s for.
We’re building a a web-application (for a proposal) to help foster parents:
•	Create / update a profile 
•	Message their case workers online via a private inbox
•	Find foster agencies

We’d like to ask you a few questions to help us understand how you might use a system like this, and so we know how to build it.

###Timeline
•	30 minutes for questions
•	30 minutes for brainstorming / sketching
o	After that, we have a few mockups to show you, and then we’ll do some sketching on paper (or whiteboard) to get your feedback.

Do you have any questions for us before we begin?
