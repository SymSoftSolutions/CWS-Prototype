**Description**

SymSoft Solutions User Centered Agile Development approach delivers fast value while generating usable software since the first iteration rather than create independent software components that do not provide any real value to the end user. For the development of this prototype, we adhered to the [principles of the agile manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

**Traditional Approach**

**Our User-Cetered Agile Development Approach**

![Agile Approach](/docs/sprint_0/process/images/agileapproach.png)

We decided to use Scrum to help us to deliver the prototype quickly while promoting transparency and adaptation, although we know that there are some other agile development frameworks out there, we believe that Scrum makes sense for the process of demonstrating our Agile capabilities and expertise.

## Our Process Overview

![SymSoft Process](/docs/sprint_0/process/images/ourprocess.png)

**Discovery Phase**

In this phase we reviewed the project requirements and learned about Foster Care to develop a prioritized features list (the initial Product Backlog).

During this phase we executed the following tasks:

1. Reviewed and understood the project requirements and context
2. Researched foster care websites, application forms, and local resources
3. Defined the team members 
4. Created  a high-level version of the initial product backlog

**Sprint 0**

We combined User Centered Design and Agile Development. By the end of this sprint, we generated interactive mockups with full functionality as described by the State requirements

During this phase we executed the following tasks:

During this phase we executed the following tasks:

*User Centered Design:*

•	Interviewed a foster parent to understand his challenges, and vision for improved digital foster care services
•	Created User Personas 
•	Designed high fidelity product wireframes and reviewed them with users
•	Gathered visual design, branding, and marketing guidelines

*Agile Process:*

•	Refined Product Backlog with Acceptance Criteria
•	Agreed on Sprint and Release Level Definition of Done
•	Defined code standards and design guidelines for upcoming sprints
•	Set up Continuous Integration Server and Continuous deployment strategy 
•	Defined the project Technology Stack 
•	Application Architecture
•	Setup Agile tracking tools (Jira)	

**Sprint 1-N**

We developed the prototype through two week-long sprints and utilized Scrum as our agile development framework. 

During this phase we executed the following activities and tasks:

•	Sprint Planning
•	Sprint Backlog Refining
•	Daily Scrums (15 minute meetings)
•	Sprint Reviews
•	Sprint Retrospectives
•	Test Driven Development for Automated testing
•	Code Review sessions
•	Pair programming and pair testing
•	Regression testing
•	Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
•	Continuous Monitoring with AWS Cloudwatch
•	Manual testing in multiple mobile devices
•	Cross-browser testing
